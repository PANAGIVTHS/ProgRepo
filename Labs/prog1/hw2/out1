Who can enjoy the lovely land when there is fear
in the heart ? Who can walk quietly in the shadow
of the jacarandas , when their beauty is grown to
danger ? I have one great fear in my heart , that
one day when they turn to loving they will find
we are turned to hating . Oh ! The grave and
sombre words
