But the rich green hills break down . 
They fall to the valley below , and falling , change their nature . 
For they grow red and bare ; they cannot hold the rain and mist
 and the streams are dry in the kloofs 				
. Too many cattle feed upon the grass	   and too many fires have burned it 



. Stand shod upon it , for it is coarse and sharp , and the stones cut under the feet. 


Keep it , guard it , care for it  for it keeps men , guards men , cares for men . Destroy it and man is destroyed .
