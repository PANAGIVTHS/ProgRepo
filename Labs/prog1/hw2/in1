 who can enjoy the lovely land 
when there is fear in the heart ? WHO can walk quietly in the shadow of the
jacarandas , WHEN their beauty is grown to danger ?


i have one great fear in my heart , that one day when they turn to loving 
they will find we are turned to hating . Oh ! the grave and sombre words
